# Course Compiler
This is a compiler I created in class under supervision by Professor Zachary Palmer of Swarthmore. The main functionality of the compiler is implemented in the src/compiler.ml file. It was coded primarily in OCaml and produced .s Assembly files that were executed by the computer. The garbage collection feature was coded in C.
